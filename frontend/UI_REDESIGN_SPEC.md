# Toban Contribution Viewer UI Redesign Specification

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive redesign of the Toban Contribution Viewer user interface, focusing on improving navigation, accessibility of analytics features, and overall user experience.

## Current Pain Points

1. **Analytics Page Accessibility**: Analytics features are difficult to access and not prominently exposed in the UI
2. **Inefficient Side Menu**: The current sidebar doesn't prioritize the most common user workflows
3. **Complex Navigation Flows**: Too many steps required to access analysis reports
4. **Disconnected Experience**: Integration management and analytics are separated despite being conceptually related

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Reduce UI complexity and cognitive load
2. **Discoverability**: Make key features and workflows immediately apparent 
3. **Efficiency**: Minimize clicks for common tasks
4. **Consistency**: Maintain uniform patterns across the application
5. **Context**: Provide relevant options based on the user's current focus

## Redesign Components
