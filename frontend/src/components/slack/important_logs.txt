# OAuth Flow Debugging Logs

## OAuth Flow Issues

1. Client ID and Client Secret not being properly passed through the OAuth flow
   - ConnectWorkspace component now saves these in sessionStorage
   - OAuthCallback component retrieves them during the OAuth flow

2. Team ID not available at the time of OAuth callback
   - Added logic to wait for team context to load before proceeding
   - Added timeout to prevent indefinite loading

3. Slack API Client URL Formation
   - Fixed base URL path in SlackApiClient to properly handle team-scoped integrations
   - Added proper error handling for API responses

## API Response Conversion

1. Backend failing to properly convert SQLAlchemy models to Pydantic schemas
   - Added conversion functions for ServiceResource, IntegrationShare, and ResourceAccess
   - Updated error handling for null responses

2. Resource Sync Button
   - Fixed issues with the sync resources button not working properly
   - Added proper URL formation in the API client

## Team-Based Integration Model

1. Transitioning from legacy Slack integration to team-based model
   - Each team now has its own integration
   - OAuth callback requires team context
   - Client credentials collected on a per-team basis instead of environment variables

## Error Debugging (April 15-18)

1. Authorization Error (April 17):
   - Error: Failed to complete OAuth handshake with Slack
   - Status: 400
   - Details: Invalid client_secret parameter
   - Resolution: Fixed parameter passing from frontend to backend

2. OAuth Token Expiration (April 17):
   - Error: Failed to fetch channel list
   - Status: 401
   - Details: Token expired or revoked
   - Resolution: Added reconnection flow in IntegrationDetail component

3. URL Construction Issue (April 15):
   - Error: Duplicate path segment in URL 
   - URL: https://api.example.com/api/slack/slack/oauth-callback
   - Fixed URL: https://api.example.com/api/slack/oauth-callback

4. Reconnection Error (April 18):
   - Error: Failed to reconnect Slack workspace
   - Status: 409
   - Details: Workspace already connected to team "Engineering"
   - WorkspaceID: W0123456789
   - AttemptedTeamID: team_67890
   - Resolution: Need to implement uniqueness constraints

## Next Steps

1. Implement uniqueness constraints for (team_id, slack_workspace_id)
2. Create detailed API and UI implementation plans
3. Add proper error handling for duplicate workspace connections
4. Implement reconnection flow for expired or revoked tokens
