# OAuth Flow Debugging Logs

## OAuth Flow Issues

1. Client ID and Client Secret not being properly passed through the OAuth flow
   - ConnectWorkspace component now saves these in sessionStorage
   - OAuthCallback component retrieves them during the OAuth flow

2. Team ID not available at the time of OAuth callback
   - Added logic to wait for team context to load before proceeding
   - Added timeout to prevent indefinite loading

3. Slack API Client URL Formation
   - Fixed base URL path in SlackApiClient to properly handle team-scoped integrations
   - Added proper error handling for API responses

## API Response Conversion

1. Backend failing to properly convert SQLAlchemy models to Pydantic schemas
   - Added conversion functions for ServiceResource, IntegrationShare, and ResourceAccess
   - Updated error handling for null responses

2. Resource Sync Button
   - Fixed issues with the sync resources button not working properly
   - Added proper URL formation in the API client

## Team-Based Integration Model

1. Transitioning from legacy Slack integration to team-based model
   - Each team now has its own integration
   - OAuth callback requires team context
   - Client credentials collected on a per-team basis instead of environment variables

## Next Steps

1. Test the full OAuth flow with the restored form fields
2. Verify the integration resource endpoints work correctly
3. Ensure proper team context loading in all application flows
