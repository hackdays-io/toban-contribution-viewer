# UI Layout Inconsistencies - Future Work

## Current Issues

We still have some layout inconsistencies across the application that should be addressed in a future update:

1. **Width Inconsistencies**: Despite standardizing on a 1440px max width, some components still expand beyond their containers or appear narrower than others.

2. **Dashboard Layout**: The Dashboard page has been redesigned with a cleaner DOM structure, but might still have minor alignment issues with the rest of the application.

3. **Card Layout Variations**: Different pages use different card and grid layouts, leading to inconsistent spacing and alignment.

4. **Navigation Tabs**: The top navigation tabs have different widths based on the content, which can cause visual shifts when navigating.

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Create a Standardized Layout System

- Implement a shared layout component library with consistent spacing
- Define a clear grid system to be used throughout the application
- Document proper container nesting patterns

### 2. Standardize Width Management

- Enforce max width constraints at the container level only
- Remove width overrides in child components
- Use percentage-based widths where appropriate

### 3. Implement Comprehensive Design Tokens

- Create a design token system for spacing, typography, colors
- Replace hardcoded values with token references
- Document the token system for all future development

### 4. Conduct UI Audit

- Perform a comprehensive audit of all UI components
- Document inconsistencies and prioritize fixes
- Create a test suite for ensuring layout consistency

## Next Steps

1. Complete the UI audit
2. Prioritize fixes based on visual impact
3. Create component layout guidelines
4. Implement fixes in a dedicated UI consistency PR
