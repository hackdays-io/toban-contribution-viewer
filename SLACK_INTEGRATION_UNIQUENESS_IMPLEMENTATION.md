# Slack Integration Uniqueness Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of uniqueness constraints for Slack integrations. The implementation ensures that a team can only connect to a specific Slack workspace once, preventing duplicate integrations while providing a seamless reconnection experience for token refreshes.

## Backend Changes

### 1. SlackIntegrationService Enhancements

- Added `find_integration_by_workspace_id` method to find existing integrations by team ID and workspace ID
- Added `update_existing_integration` method to handle updating tokens and metadata for existing integrations
- Modified `create_from_oauth` method to check for existing integrations before creating new ones
- Implemented workspace ID extraction and validation from OAuth responses

### 2. API Endpoint Modifications

- Updated the `/slack` endpoint to distinguish between creating and updating integrations
- Added appropriate status codes (201 for new, 200 for updated)
- Enhanced response schema to include an `updated` flag for reconnection scenarios
- Added proper error handling for various authentication scenarios

## Frontend Changes

### 1. OAuthCallback Component Updates

- Enhanced to handle reconnection flows via `slack_integration_id` in session storage
- Added status states for reconnection success/failure
- Updated UI to show different messages for new connections vs. reconnections
- Implemented clear error handling for expired/revoked tokens

### 2. ReconnectIntegration Component

- Created new modal component for reconnection flows
- Implemented Slack client credential collection with validation
- Added session storage management for reconnection data passing
- Provided clear user feedback during reconnection process

### 3. IntegrationDetail Component Enhancements

- Added reconnect button for expired/revoked tokens
- Implemented warning banner for integrations needing reconnection
- Added connection status information with appropriate visual indicators
- Enhanced status display with actionable reconnection options

## Data Flow

1. **New Integration Flow**:
   - User enters credentials and selects team
   - OAuth flow completes and backend checks for existing integration
   - If none exists, a new integration is created
   - Frontend shows success message for new connection

2. **Reconnection Flow**:
   - User clicks "Reconnect" on an expired/revoked integration
   - Integration ID is stored in session storage
   - OAuth flow completes with reconnection flag
   - Backend finds existing integration and updates it
   - Frontend shows success message for reconnection

3. **Duplicate Detection**:
   - When a team attempts to connect to a workspace already integrated
   - Backend identifies duplicate and updates instead of creating new
   - Frontend receives 200 status with `updated: true` flag
   - User sees appropriate message about reconnection

## Security Considerations

- Sensitive credentials are removed from session storage after OAuth flow
- Error messages provide useful information without leaking sensitive details
- Token refresh follows OAuth best practices
- Connection state is securely tracked across the OAuth flow

## User Experience Improvements

- Clear distinction between new connections and reconnections
- Intuitive reconnection flow from integration details page
- Prominent warning banners for expired/revoked tokens
- Simplified reconnection process requiring minimal user interaction
- Consistent status indicators across the application
