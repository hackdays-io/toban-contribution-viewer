# Slack Integration Uniqueness Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement
Currently, when users create a new Slack integration, the system allows creating duplicate integrations between the same team and Slack workspace. This leads to confusion, potential data inconsistencies, and redundant API calls.

## Goal
Implement a uniqueness constraint for Slack integrations to ensure that each team can only connect to a specific Slack workspace once.

## Uniqueness Definition
For our application, a Slack integration should be considered unique based on:
- **Primary key**: (team_id, slack_workspace_id)
- This prevents a team from creating multiple connections to the same Slack workspace
- Each team can still connect to multiple different Slack workspaces
- Each Slack workspace can be connected to multiple different teams

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analyze Current Data Structure

1. Examine current database schema:
   - Check `Integration` model and related tables
   - Identify where workspace information is stored (likely in `integration_metadata` or similar)
   - Review existing constraints and indexes

2. Investigate current integration creation flow:
   - Examine how Slack workspace IDs are obtained during OAuth
   - Review how integrations are stored after OAuth completion
   - Identify integration points for uniqueness checks

### Phase 2: Backend Changes

1. Database modifications:
   - We can remove exsisting data before modification. Don't need to think about data migration

2. API endpoint modifications:
   - Update integration creation endpoint to check for duplicates
   - Add appropriate error responses for duplicate attempts
   - Document API changes
   - detail: [SLACK_INTEGRATION_API_PLAN.md]

3. Service layer changes:
   - Modify `SlackIntegrationService.create_from_oauth` to handle duplicates
   - Add functions to check for existing integrations
   - Implement proper transaction handling for potential race conditions

### Phase 3: Frontend Changes

1. User interface modifications:
   - Add user-friendly error messages for duplicate integrations
   - Consider showing existing integrations during connection flow
   - Enhance user feedback for connection attempts
   - detail: [SLACK_INTEGRATION_UI_PLAN.md]

2. Integration management improvements:
   - Update integration list to better display existing connections
   - Add reconnect/refresh functionality for existing integrations
   - Consider adding integration status indicator

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation

1. Unit testing:
   - Test uniqueness constraints at database level
   - Test API responses for duplicate attempts
   - Verify error handling in service layer

2. Integration testing:
   - Test OAuth flow attempting duplicate connections
   - Verify proper user feedback
   - Test edge cases (race conditions, concurrent attempts)

3. Migration testing:
   - Ensure existing integrations continue to work
   - Verify handling of legacy data

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Database enforces uniqueness for (team_id, slack_workspace_id)
2. Users receive clear error messages when attempting to create duplicate integrations
3. Existing duplicate integrations (if any) are handled gracefully
4. OAuth flow properly identifies and handles reconnection attempts
5. Metrics are in place to track duplicate connection attempts

## Implementation Notes

- Workspace ID can be obtained from OAuth response as `team.id`
- Need to handle reconnection use case (user intentionally reconnecting an existing integration)
- Consider UX for helping users understand which integrations already exist
- Integration status should be updated instead of creating duplicates
- Implement appropriate error handling that provides useful context

## Future Considerations

- Implement integration versioning or history
- Add support for multiple installation types within the same workspace (user vs. workspace installations)
- Consider Enterprise Grid support (enterprise_id + team_id uniqueness)
- Add integration health checks and automatic reconnection capabilities
