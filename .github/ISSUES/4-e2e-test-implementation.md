## Overview

Implement end-to-end tests using Playwright to verify key user flows in the application.

## Background & Purpose

End-to-end tests are essential for verifying that the entire application works correctly from the user's perspective. By automating these tests, we can catch regressions early and ensure that critical user flows continue to work as expected.

## Implementation Details

1. Set up Playwright in the test runner container
2. Implement tests for key user flows:
   - Authentication flow (registration, login, team switching)
   - Slack integration flow (connecting workspace, syncing channels, selecting channels)
   - Analysis flow (running analysis, viewing results)
   - Team management flow (creating teams, inviting members)
3. Create helper functions for common operations
4. Configure test reporting

## Related Issues

- #1 Set up Docker Compose Integration Testing Framework Structure
- #2 Implement Slack API Mock Service
- #3 Create Slack Data Fetching Script

## Completion Criteria

- Tests are implemented for all key user flows
- Tests run successfully in the Docker Compose environment
- Test reports are generated
- Tests are stable and not flaky

## Additional Notes

Focus on the most critical user flows first. Tests should be designed to be resilient to minor UI changes and should use data attributes or other stable selectors rather than relying on text content or CSS classes that might change.
