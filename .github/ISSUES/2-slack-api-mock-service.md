## Overview

Implement a mock service that simulates the Slack API for integration testing.

## Background & Purpose

Integration tests need to run reliably without depending on external services. A mock Slack API service will allow tests to run consistently without requiring actual Slack credentials or network connectivity, while still testing the application's integration with Slack.

## Implementation Details

1. Create a Node.js Express server in `integration-tests/mocks/slack-api/`
2. Implement key Slack API endpoints:
   - `/api/conversations.list` - List channels
   - `/api/conversations.history` - Get channel messages
   - `/api/users.info` - Get user information
   - `/api/oauth.v2.access` - OAuth authentication
3. Create a Dockerfile for the mock service
4. Implement a data loading mechanism that reads test data from JSON files
5. Add a health check endpoint for Docker Compose

## Related Issues

- #1 Set up Docker Compose Integration Testing Framework Structure
- #3 Create Slack Data Fetching Script

## Completion Criteria

- Mock service implements all required Slack API endpoints
- Service can load test data from JSON files
- Service is containerized and can be started with Docker Compose
- Health check endpoint is working

## Additional Notes

The mock service should exactly match the response format of the real Slack API to ensure tests are valid. The implementation should be flexible enough to handle different test scenarios by loading different test data files.
