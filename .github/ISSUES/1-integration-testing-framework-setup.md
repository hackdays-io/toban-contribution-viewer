## Overview

Create the basic structure for the Docker Compose integration testing framework as outlined in the integration testing strategy document.

## Background & Purpose

Currently, the project has separate unit tests for frontend and backend, but lacks comprehensive end-to-end testing that verifies the entire application flow. This task establishes the foundation for a Docker Compose-based integration testing framework that will enable full-stack testing.

## Implementation Details

1. Create the `integration-tests` directory at the project root
2. Set up the following directory structure:
   ```
   integration-tests/
   ├── setup/
   ├── mocks/
   │   ├── slack-api/
   │   └── openrouter-api/
   ├── tests/
   │   ├── e2e/
   │   └── api/
   └── utils/
   ```
3. Create initial configuration files:
   - `docker-compose.test.yml`
   - `Dockerfile.test-runner`
   - `run-tests.sh`
   - `setup/wait-for-services.sh`

## Related Documentation

- [Integration Testing Strategy](../../docs/integration-testing-strategy.md)

## Related Issues

- #2 Implement Slack API Mock Service
- #3 Create Slack Data Fetching Script

## Completion Criteria

- Directory structure is created
- Initial configuration files are in place
- Basic README with setup instructions is added
- Docker Compose configuration can start the test environment (even if tests aren't implemented yet)

## Additional Notes

This task focuses on setting up the structure only. Actual implementation of tests and mock services will be handled in subsequent tasks.
