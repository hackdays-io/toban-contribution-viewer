## Overview

Integrate the Docker Compose integration testing framework with the project's CI/CD pipeline.

## Background & Purpose

Automating integration tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline ensures that these tests are run consistently on every code change, providing early feedback on potential issues and preventing regressions.

## Implementation Details

1. Create a GitHub Actions workflow for integration tests
2. Configure the workflow to:
   - Check out the code
   - Set up Docker Buildx
   - Run the integration tests
   - Upload test reports as artifacts
3. Configure environment variables and secrets
4. Optimize test execution time for CI environment

## Related Issues

- #1 Set up Docker Compose Integration Testing Framework Structure
- #4 Implement End-to-End Tests with Playwright

## Completion Criteria

- GitHub Actions workflow is created and functional
- Integration tests run automatically on pull requests and pushes to main
- Test reports are available as artifacts
- Tests complete in a reasonable time

## Additional Notes

Consider strategies to optimize test execution time in the CI environment, such as running tests in parallel or selectively running tests based on changed files. Also consider how to handle flaky tests to prevent false negatives from blocking the pipeline.
